The following files in this directory have been migrated to the new
Xfconf configuration system and can be safely deleted if you so desire:

    desktop.xml
    gtk.xml
    workspaces.xml
    xfprint.xml

Other files have not been migrated and the applications previously using
them may need to be reconfigured manually.
